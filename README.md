# GoTicket
A RESTful movie ticket booking web application. 
- The backend was implemented in Java EE using spring framework. 
- The theater and show information was stored in MySQL database using Hibernate.
- The movie ticket service provided search option for shows and theater.
- It also provided movie booking service. 
- The front end was written using HTML, CSS and AngularJS**

** *I was not able to find the UI which was written in HTML, CSS and AngularJS. So I have uploaded the intermediate version.*
